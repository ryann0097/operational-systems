/** NOTE:
 * Unlike "exerciseThree.c", we're not using shared memory resources.
 * And the question is: why not?
 * Let me break it for you: the communication between processes needs to make system calls (syscalls) to
 * share information, due to the principles of "Process Isolation" and "OS Security". These principles ensure that
 * each process operates in its own isolated memory space, which prevents unauthorized access and modifications
 * to the data of other processes. This design enhances the overall security of the operating system by controlling
 * the flow of information between processes, making the exchange more secure and reliable.
 * 
 * In contrast, threads are merely instances of the same process, meaning they share the same address space
 * and resources as the calling thread. Because of this shared context, threads can communicate and access
 * shared data directly without needing to make system calls. This reduces the overhead associated with communication
 * but introduces potential risks, such as race conditions if multiple threads attempt to modify shared data simultaneously.
 * Therefore, while using shared memory can facilitate efficient communication within a single process context,
 * the mechanisms that govern process communication must be in place to uphold the principles of isolation and security 
 * across different processes in a multi-process environment.
